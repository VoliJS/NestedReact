	<strong>NestedReact</strong> bridges the gap between React and traditional MVC frameworks,
	combining familiar OO state management and two-way data binding with all the benefits of true unidirectional data flow.
</p>

<p class="lead">
    It's MVC framework taking <a src="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> for "V" and <a href="https://github.com/Volicon/NestedTypes">NestedTypes</a> for "M", while being unopinionated on "C".

* Automatic serialization and REST
* Aggregation, "to-one", and "to-many" relashionships.

#### React for "V"

React. Extended to play well with MVC. 

* Simple technique to manage all application state
    * Handle complex UI state with NestedTypes
    * Unidirectional data flow
    * Automatic "pure render" optimization 
* Handle forms naturally
    * Two-way data binding
    * Declarative form validation 
* *React mixins* with ES6 classes.
* Cuts your code 2-5x compared to React/Redux.
