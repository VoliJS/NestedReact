	<strong>NestedReact</strong> bridges the gap between React and traditional MVC frameworks,
	combining two-way data binding and familiar OO state management with all the benefits of true unidirectional data flow.
</p>

<p class="lead">
    It's MVC framework taking <a src="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> for "V" and <a href="https://github.com/Volicon/NestedTypes">NestedTypes</a> for "M", while being unopinionated on "C".

#### React for "V"

* Model instead of `state`
* Mutable models in props
    * Unidirectional Data Flow
    * "pure render" optimization
    * local updates on changes
