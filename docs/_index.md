#### Unidirectional data flow

* Traditional OO data layer
* Same technique for managing application and UI local state
* "pure render" optimization

</div>
<div class=col-third>

#### Two-way data binding

* Value links
* Form validation

</div>
<div class=col-third>

#### Easy migration from BackboneJS

* Use Backbone Views from React
* Use React components as Backbone Views
